# React Express Boilerplate

## What is this?

The minimalist template which uses:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev): Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- [React](https://reactjs.org): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): The most popular backend framework for Node. js.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Framework for building, running, and managing containers on servers and the cloud.
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/): Web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.
